# c++ Calculator
This is just a simple project to create a calculator, using C++. I chose to do this because the underlying concept of the program is not too difficult but it will allow me to use different data structures, complex operations, and a bit of file manipulation. There will be a few renditions of it and I will outline them below (including where I am):
  - ~~Basic operators and only 2 numbers~~
    - [x] Simple menu asking what operation user wants
    - [x] Implementing simple operators
  - Options menu
    - [ ] Changing of decimal accurary
  - Inputting of operation into "memory" and retrieval of memory
    - [ ] Adding features to menu to save result of last operation
  - List of previous operations
    - [ ] Add to menu option to display last operations
    - [ ] Implement via linked list, can be toggled to just display result or full calculation
    - [ ] Option to export session history to text file
  - Basic operators and up to 64 numbers, specifiying how many numbers there will be
    - [ ] Update previous operators LL to new input size
  - Basic operators and up to 64 numbers, no specifying how many numbers
    - [ ] Removal of operation menu and replacing with typing in full equation
    - [ ] Varifying equation is syntactically correct (no double operators, operands on both sides of operators, etc.)
  - Above with order of operations
    - [ ] Order of operations without paraentheses
    - [ ] Adding paraentheses
    - [ ] Adding power operator
  - Adding unit conversion
    - [ ] Adding seperate option in menu
    - [ ] Common distance, weight, and temperature conversions by specfying units first
    - [ ] List of previous operations
  - Introduction of complex operators such as trig functions
    - [ ] Log/natural log
    - [ ] Simple trig functions (SIN, COS, TAN)
    - [ ] Complex trig functions
  - Introduction of simple calculus functions
    - [ ] Simple derivatives
    - [ ] Simple integrals
