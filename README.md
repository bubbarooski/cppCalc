# c++Calc
This is just a simple project to create a calculator, using C++. There will be a few renditions of it and I will outline them below (including where I am):
  - Basic operators and only 2 numbers
    - ~~Simple menu asking what operation user wants~~
    - Implementing simple operators
  - Options menu
    - Changing of decimal accurary
  - Inputting of operation into "memory" and retrieval of memory
    - Adding features to menu to save result of last operation
  - List of previous operations
    - Add to menu option to display last operations
    - Implement via linked list, can be toggled to just display result or full calculation
  - Basic operators and up to 64 numbers, specifiying how many numbers there will be
    - Update previous operators LL to new input size
  - Basic operators and up to 64 numbers, no specifying how many numbers
    - Removal of operation menu and replacing with typing in full equation
    - Varifying equation is syntactically correct (no double operators, operands on both sides of operators, etc.)
  - Above with order of operations
    - Order of operations without paraentheses
    - Adding paraentheses
    - Adding power operator
  - Adding unit conversion
    - Adding seperate option in menu
    - Common distance, weight, and temperature conversions by specfying units first
    - List of previous operations
  - Introduction of complex operators such as trig functions
  - Introduction of simple calc functions
